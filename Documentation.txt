Integration Guide for qb-spawnselector with qb-apartments

Step 1: Modify the Configuration

1. Locate the Config File: Navigate to the config.lua within the qb-apartments directory.
2. Edit the Apartments Table: Inside the config.lua file, you'll find the Apartments.Locations table. This contains details for each apartment like name, label, and coords.
3. Add Spawn Selector Coordinates:
Locate the coords for where you want to integrate the spawn selector.
Insert a new line below the enter coordinates and add the following properties to set the initial spawn selector position:

x = 0,  -- Horizontal offset
y = 0   -- Vertical offset


The updated section should look like this:

coords = {
     enter = vector4(-667.02, -1105.24, 14.63, 242.32),
     x = 0,
     y = 0
},


4.Adjust the Position:
The x value adjusts the spawn marker's position from left to right.
The y value adjusts the spawn marker's position from top to bottom.
Modify these values to position the spawn selector marker accurately on your UI.
If your configuration matches the example, you've successfully set up the integration. Finalize by adjusting the x and y values to align the marker to the desired location on the screen.
